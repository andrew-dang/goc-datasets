# Automating Data Collection
To aid with Transition Torontoâ€™s mission of facilitating data-driven climate resilience decision-making in urban communities, this project was been developed to automate the process of obtaining datasets from the Government of Canada (GoC) Open Data Portal. 

This project uses Prefect and PostgreSQL setup in containers with Docker Compose to automate the data collection process.
